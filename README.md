# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## What I Learned
We had a great introduction to Third Party API's this week. 

With a focus on; DOM Traversal, JQuery, BootStrap, Google Fonts, and event delegation to name a few. 

## What Problems Did we Solve?
The HTML, CSS were given to us and I had to create JavaScript and README file from scratch. 
  
This was our 5th week and still struggling a bit with JavaScript however starting to tie all the elements together with a lot of reading and googling.

My JavaScript Work Day Scheduler changes color to show either past, present or future time blocks within the calander. You can also add multiple lines of text by hitting enter.
The following image shows the web application's appearance:
